		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>
			PolePosition is a benchmark test suite to compare 
            database engines and object-relational mapping technology. It is by no means 
            complete. Database vendors and open source database project contributors are 
            invited to improve the test implementations and to write further scenarios 
            (&quot;Circuits&quot;). The PolePosition framework will help to implement tests 
            quickly and to time and output the results as number series and graph 
			visualizations.
		</p>
		<p>
			The authors of the current test implementations do not see themselves as 
			experts for SQL, JDO, JPA, Hibernate or Datanucleus. If 
			you can provide a faster implementation for a circuit, please 
			supply it to the PolePosition project. 
		</p>
		<p>
		The results 
			show that there can not be one single "best product". Depending on 
			your application, some circuit results may be very important for you and some 
			may be irrelevant. If you consider basing your choice of database on 
			this benchmark,

            the sources and bring along time to look at what every circuit does.</p>

		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>
			We provide sample results from two different runs as PDF files:
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="results/PolePositionEmbedded.pdf" target="_blank">Embedded Results</a><br /> 
            Database setups 
            with low resource consumption and low administration costs, 
            for instance for (mobile) devices.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="results/PolePositionClientServer.pdf" target="_blank">Client/Server Results</a><br />
            Database setups with client/server functionality for scalable applications.</p>
        <p>
            An explanation about each benchmark scenario (&quot;Circuit&quot;) and what it does can be 
            found <a href="circuits.html">here</a>.</p>
		<p>
			You are encouraged to 
            <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=134549" target="_blank">download</a>
            the PolePosition suite and to run the tests yourself with your 
			favourite databases on your hardware, see <a href="#running">Running the tests</a>. 
            If you are evaluating databases for a concrete scenario, the best thing you can 
            do is to write your own customized circuit for this use case.</p>

		<a name="interpretation"></a>
		<h2>Interpretation</h2>
		<p>
			As already expressed above, there is no best product. The importance of 
			individual results will depend on the respective application. However we think 
			that we can draw some general conclusions from the results that may be valid 
			for everyone:<ul>
				<li>
				    When you interpret the results, you should focus on significant differences, 
                    where the results differ by an order of magnitude. If you see differences of 
                    only 20% or 30% this may be an effect of Java garbage collection.<li>
				    The longer the tests run (see the milliseconds values), the more 
                    meaningful the results will be.<li>
				HSQLDB looks very good on many graphs, because much processing is done in 
				memory. We configured HSQLDB to use cached tables and with write_delay=false to be 
                    fair to other databases that flush file buffers on commit. Before you consider to use HSQLDB for a complex database application, you 
				should take a close look at Complex:query. The query optimizer does not seem 
				to cope with a query over five tables. 
				<li>
		The use of O-R mapping technology like Hibernate, 
                    Datanucleus or OpenJPA has a 
				negative impact on performance. O-R mapping advocates may tell you that 
				caching will bring you back performance. Do not 
				forget: Data that comes from a cache can always be stale in a multi-user 
				application. If you want your data to be up-to-date, you have to reread from 
				the database.
				<li>
			As would be expected, object databases like db4o and Versant VOD provide best performance for 
				inheritance hierarchies, complex structures and navigational access to object 
                    members. 
				<li>
				If you take a look at the sources of the tests, they are also a measurement, 
					how easy it is to work against a specific database. SQL statements look like 
                    aliens in Java code, ugly, difficult to write, debug and refactor. O-R mappers and 
					object databases make life so much easier and productive for developers. The task of storing 
					objects is very similar among all the products tested. A common 
                    object-oriented query language, like LINQ, would be great for Java.</li>

		<h2>Download</h2>
		<p>
		All sources of the PolePosition test suite including some open source 
			database engines to run tests are available for download 
            <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=134549" target="_blank">here</a>.

		<h2>Running the tests</h2>
		<p>
			We recommend you to use the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> IDE 
			to&nbsp;work with the test source code. The distribution contains a .project 
			file for Eclipse to get you started quickly.
		</p>
		<p>
	The full test suite with all engines takes a full night to run on a fast machine. 
            Before your first run you may 
			like to take a look at the configuration possibilities, so you can first check 
            that all configured databases run through successfully.</p>
        <p>
		Changing org.polepos.Settings.DEBUG to true will run all benchmarks with less 
            objects.</p>
		<p>
			The main class to start the PolePosition suite is org.polepos.RunSeasonAfterEnhancing..<br />
            To run with all engines in one go, you need quite a lot of RAM. We ran with 
            -Xmx1500m</p>
        <p>
			Here are the most important files, that you may want to customize:
		</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					org.polepos.RunSeason sets up the teams and the circuits. You can comment out 
                    any circuit or team you don&#39;t want to run<li>
					/settings/Jdbc.properties<br>
					configures the JDBC databases and connection parameters that are to be used and 
                    which JDBC databases Hibernate is to run with.<BR>
					<li>
					/settings/Jdo.properties<BR>
					configures the JDO databases and connection parameters that are to be used.<BR>
				<li>
					/settings/Jpa.properties<br />
                    configures the JPA databases and connection parameters to be used.<br />
                    For JPA you also have to edit /src/META-INF/persistence.xml<li>
					/settings/Circuits.properties<BR>
					configures the settings for all circuits<BR>
				<li>
					/results/<BR>
		is where the results of your test run will end up. 
                    Open PolePosition.pdf from there when your test run is done. <BR>
				<li>
					/build.xmll<BR>
		is a simple Ant script to help you compile and run the tests, if you prefer 
					Ant to running from within Eclipse.
				</li>
			</ul>

		<h2>Source Code</h2>
		<p>
			What 
			you may want to look for:<ul>
				<li>
					Circuit<br>
				a set of timed test cases that work against the same data
				<li>
					Lap<br>
				a single (timed) test
				<li>
					Team<br>
				a specific database category or engine that requires specific source code
				<li>
					Car<br>
				a specialized implementation of a team
				<li>
					Driver<br>
				an implementation of a circuit for a team
				<li>
			Since JDO, Hibernate 
                    and JPA modify classes at compile/run-time, they need their own 
					set of persistent classes for the tests. Accordingly we did not consider it a good idea to 
					pass a set of objects from the outside into the write methods. Instead we give 
					all implementations full freedom, to do all the work on their own. By 
					collecting checksums for every timed task, the benchmark test makes sure that 
					no implementation cheats by accident.
