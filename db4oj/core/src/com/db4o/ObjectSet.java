 * An ObjectSet is a representation for a set of objects returned

 * <br><br>ObjectSet extends the system collection interfaces 
 * java.util.List/System.Collections.IList where they are available. It is
 * recommended, never to reference ObjectSet directly in code but to use
 * List / IList instead.
 * <br><br>Note that the underlying 
 * {@link ObjectContainer ObjectContainer} of an ObjectSet
 * needs to remain open as long as an ObjectSet is used. This is necessary
 * for lazy instantiation. The objects in an ObjectSet are only instantiated
 * when they are actually being used by the application. 
 * @see ExtObjectSet for extended functionality.
