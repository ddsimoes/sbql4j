 * To constrain a {@link Query} node with your own callback
 * <code>Evaluation</code>, construct an object that implements the
 * <code>Evaluation</code> interface and register it by passing it
 * to {@link Query#constrain(Object)}.
 * <br><br>
 * Evaluations are called as the last step during query execution,
 * after all other constraints have been applied. Evaluations in higher
 * level {@link Query} nodes in the query graph are called first.
 * <br><br>Java client/server only:<br>
 * db4o first attempts to use Java Serialization to allow to pass final
 * variables to the server. Please make sure that all variables that are
 * used within the {@link #evaluate(Candidate)} method are Serializable. This may include
 * the class an anonymous Evaluation object is created in. If db4o is
 * not successful at using Serialization, the Evaluation is transported
 * to the server in a db4o {@link com.db4o.io.MemoryBin}. In this case final variables can
 * not be restored.
