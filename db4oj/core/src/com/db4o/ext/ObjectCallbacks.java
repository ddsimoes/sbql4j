/**
 * callback methods.
 * <br><br>
 * This interface only serves as a list of all available callback methods.
 * Every method is called individually, independantly of implementing this interface.<br><br>
 * <b>Using callbacks</b><br>
 * Simply implement one or more of the listed methods in your application classes to
 * do tasks before activation, deactivation, delete, new or update, to cancel the
 * action about to be performed and to respond to the performed task.
 * <br><br>Callback methods are typically used for:
 * <br>- cascaded delete
 * <br>- cascaded update
 * <br>- cascaded activation
 * <br>- restoring transient members on instantiation
 * <br><br>Callback methods follow regular calling conventions. Methods in superclasses
 * need to be called explicitely.
 * <br><br>All method calls are implemented to occur only once, upon one event.
